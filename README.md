## Reflection

### What was the context for this project?

This project was built during June 2021 to July 2021. Project goals included building a crypto cureency price tracker web app using technologies like JavaScript, React and Coingecko API.

### What did you set out to build?

Originally I wanted to build an application that allowed users to watch live prices of the most popular crypto currencies. I started this process by building the React App using the `create-react-app` boilerplate for the frontend and Coingecki Public API.

### What are the challenges?

One of the main challenges I ran into was finding a free reliable crypto API. This lead me to spend a few days on research. But then, I finally decided to use Coingecko's API as of now.

### Conclusion

At the end of the day, it was a nice experience building the project. For the time constraints I can't make the app responsive, in the next iteration I plan to make it fully responsive.
